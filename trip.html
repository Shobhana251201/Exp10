Located on the east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge (Port Jackson), New South Wales, Australia, the Opera House was even designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007 and it is one of the finest places to visit in Sydney.The grand and beautiful Sydney Harbour Bridge has become an architectural symbol that is instinctively a signifier of not only Sydney but also Australia. It has been a quintessential icon of Sydney and an important part of the city’s landscape since 1932 and it is one of the finest places to visit in Sydney.The iconic stretch of the fine white sand along Bondi makes Bondi Beach one of Australia’s most popular beach destinations. The sand that glistens in the sun and the curling waves make it a paradise for surfers and deep-sea swimmers.

        <h1 style="color: brown;font: size 40px; text-align:center">Santorini Islands, Greece</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 70px;padding-right:70px;color: rgb(94, 63, 69);font-size:24px;">Santorini is the southernmost island in the Cyclades. Its official name is Thira (Thera in classical Greek).This island is the site of one of the largest volcano eruptions in recorded history. About 3,600 years ago the volcano erupted, causing an enormous tsunami which hit the island of Crete, leading to the eventual downfall of the Minoan civilization. Now, Santorini is a waterfilled crescent, the remains of this ancient volcano. The towns of Oia, Fira, and Imerovigli are all perched along the rim of the caldera. There are more churches than houses on the island, although most of these are very small and private.Wine is a major industry here. The hot, dry climate is perfect for growing grapes, and if you like to visit wineries and go wine tasting, you’ll love Santorini. By the way, the vines are grown in coils on the ground, rather than on a trellis like you typically see in many other vineyards around the world. This is done because it’s very windy on Santorini. And yes, expect windy conditions. While we were here, there were wind gusts strong enough to knock people over, literally. January, February, July and August tend to be the windiest months on Santorini.</p>

        <h1 style="color: brown;font: size 40px; text-align:center">Peru, South America</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 70px;padding-right:70px;color: rgb(94, 63, 69);font-size:24px;">Peru is essentially a tropical country, with its northern tip nearly touching the Equator. Despite its tropical location, a great diversity of climates, ways of life, and economic activities is brought about by the extremes of elevation and by the southwest winds that sweep in across the cold Peru Current (or Humboldt Current), which flows along its Pacific shoreline.The name Peru is derived from a Quechua word implying land of abundance, a reference to the economic wealth produced by the rich and highly organized Inca civilization that ruled the region for centuries.Favourite destinations for international travelers include Machu Picchu, a site of ancient Inca ruins located about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Cuzco, and museums housing artifacts excavated from ancient tombs in northern coastal Peru.</p>
